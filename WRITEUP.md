### Cost, Scalability, Availabilty, workflow
 - In terms of costs, Azure VMs are more expensive to run in comparison to Azure App Service.
 - Azure App Service requires much less managerial efforts in comparison to Azure Virtual Machines.
 - The development of app is much simpler and faster in Azure App Service.
 - Azure App Service have constraints in comparison to Azure VMs in terms of scalability. Hence, Azure VMs are preferred for apps, which have scope to expand 	for future.

### Choice
My choice for the CMS app is deploying the app with Azure App Service because of lesser costs and managerial efforts.

### App changes that would change your decision
If in the future I want to scale my app for a larger audience, I will consider redeploying my app with Azure VM, or if I want to support certain languages that are not supported on Azure App service, but is supported on Azure VM, I will definitely re-deploy with Azure VM.
